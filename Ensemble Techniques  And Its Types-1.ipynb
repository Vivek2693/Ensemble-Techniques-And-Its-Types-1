    "## Q1. What is an ensemble techni## Que in machine learning?\n",
    "Ensemble techni## Ques combine multiple individual models to improve the overall performance of a machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. Why are ensemble techni## Ques used in machine learning?\n",
    "Ensemble techni## Ques are used to improve predictive performance, increase robustness, and reduce overfitting in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. What is bagging?\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble techni## Que where multiple bootstrapped samples of the training dataset are created, and a separate model is trained on each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. What is boosting?\n",
    "Boosting is another ensemble techni## Que where multiple weak learners are combined se## Quentially to create a strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5. What are the benefits of using ensemble techni## Ques?\n",
    "Some benefits of using ensemble techni## Ques include improved predictive accuracy, increased robustness against overfitting, and better generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6. Are ensemble techni## Ques always better than individual models?\n",
    "Ensemble techni## Ques are not always guaranteed to outperform individual models, but they often do in practice, especially when the individual models are diverse and complementary to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q7. How is the confidence interval calculated using bootstrap?\n",
    "The confidence interval using bootstrap is calculated by resampling the original dataset with replacement to create multiple bootstrap samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q8. How does bootstrap work and what are the steps involved in bootstrap?\n",
    "Bootstrap is a resampling techni## Que used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly sampling from the observed data with replacement.\n",

    "bootstrap to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height.\n",
